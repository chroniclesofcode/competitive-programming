# Competitive Programming Solutions
Archive of my solutions to various problems in competitive programming. If it is not obvious how a certain solution works, there may be some in-code comments detailing the steps taken (not guaranteed!). If you are confused about anything, feel free to send a message.

Note: I have also included questions from leetcode, which is not exactly competitve programming but still 'algorithmic'.
