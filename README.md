# Competitive Programming Solutions
Archive of my solutions to various problems in competitive programming. If it is not obvious how a certain solution works, there may be some in-code comments detailing the steps taken (not guaranteed!). If you are confused about anything or want me to write an editorial for a problem explaining how to do it, feel free to send a message (chroniclesofcode on codeforces, I am solving pretty much everyday so my response time should be fairly quick!).

Note: I have also included questions from leetcode, which is not exactly competitve programming but still 'algorithmic'.

# Things to keep in mind while on your solving journey

- Do not force a particular algorithm/methodology on a question. A lot of people come in with a mindset of 'is this DP? greedy? queue? dfs?' which is bad. You should be flexible and it's very common that a question will try to trick you into thinking it is a certain archetype.
- Try to make 'observations' that chain onto each other. Things that lead onto things will give you very logical conclusions and you can finally apply a generic algorithm at the end. First, turn the problem into something very simple - then you can finally ask 'is this DP?'.
- Upsolve. Solve questions above your level, that challenge you. This is well-known but most people need a reminder: life begins at the end of your comfort zone. If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you.
- Spend less time trying to pick the 'optimal' questions. Just solve and solve - the more experience you will gain. It doesn't matter what website, what judge - as long as it improves your problem solving skills it is valuable.
